class PyMLTrainAndPredictWorkflow(WorkflowProperty):
    """
    We expect workflows to have a format as follows:

    Workflow_Head_Subworkflow - Contains various units which prepare an ML job. For example, we may have the following
    units present.
        - An Assignment unit specifying whether the workflow is in Train or Predict mode (head-set-predict-status)
        - An IO unit to copy in the training set
        - A Conditional unit that specifies whether the train or predict setup is to be used
        - An IO unit to copy in the trained model if running in predict mode


    The final IO unit in the predict setup that we discuss, which copies in files needed for the workflow to function,
    is populated by this class's _create_download_from_object_storage_input function. It obtains a list of files
    the user has deemed important-enough to save in the workflow, and ensures they're around for the predict job.

    Workflow_Tail_Subworkflow - Contains the actual ML that the user wants to perform. The intention is that this is
    the more user-modifiable part of the ML feature. We might contain the following units here:
        - pyml:setup_variables_packages: A setup file that helps the user communicate the files needed in subsequent
                                         predict runs
        - pyml:data_input:read_csv:pandas: Uses Pandas to read in a CSV for use in further ML
        - pyml:pre_processing:standardization:sklearn: Scales the data such that it has mean=0 and variance=1, then
                                                       saves the scaler for use in predict workflows
        - pyml:model:multilayer_perceptron:sklearn: A multilayer perceptron being fit to a regression problem. Saves
                                                    the model to be used again in predict workflows
        - pyml:post_processing:parity_plot:matplotlib: Creates a parity plot if the workflow is in "Training" mode.
